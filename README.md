# Ensemble-Technique
Ensembling can be defined as a machine learning technique which combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. 
Ensemble methods help in decreasing variance, bias and improve predictions

Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms in Python with scikit-learn. Ensembles can give you a boost in accuracy on your dataset.

Combine Model Predictions Into Ensemble Predictions
The two most popular methods for combining the predictions from different models are:

Bagging: Building multiple models (typically of the same type) from different subsamples of the training dataset.
Boosting: Building multiple models (typically of the same type) each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the chain.

A standard classification problem used to demonstrate each ensemble algorithm is the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. 
It is a binary classification problem where all of the input variables are numeric and have differing scales.
